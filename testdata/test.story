start:
A cold mist rises just outside the cave as you near the exit. The
light is harsh to your unaccustomed eyes. You see an unfamiliar land
before you. The trees outside are still green, healthy, reminding you
of what the rotting husks in your now dreary village once were. The
village council enforces ever stricter rations to get the people
through these "hard times".

These aren't just "hard times". You've never seen it before, but you
can feel it. An evil is falling upon the land, and you need outside
help.

Just at that moment an unintelligible echo comes from the cave behind
you.
*faceecho* Turn to face it.
*hideecho* Take cover.

faceecho:
You slowly turn around. Facing the source of the sound, you see
nothing. The light from your torch strains against the almost
unnatural darkness, but fails after only a few feet. Dim shadows dance
along the walls in a ring around you. The sound is gone. A falling
rock? But it sounded nothing like that.
Silence now. The air grows colder.
It's time to leave this cave. You turn back to the cave's
entrance. The mist is thicker than before.  Much thicker. And in the
middle of it, there's the subtle but unmistakable outline of a shadowy
figure.
*seemiststanding* You stand, waiting.

hideecho:
You slide behind a boulder, still far enough into the cave to have the
darkness conceal you. Your body presses against the damp cold
rock. Your feet are awkwardly cramped underneath you, but you hold
still straining to hear a repeat of the sound. An eerie breeze blows
from the inside of the cave. It carries a stream of mist curling
around the rocks, joining with the mist already present at the
entrance.
Slowly, but unmistakably, a shadowy figure is taking form in the mist.
*seemiststanding* Stand to confront the figure.
*hidemist* Continue to watch from the shadows.

seemiststanding:
For a brief moment you and the shadowy figure stand motionless
opposite each other. All is silent. Dread starts setting in. Slowly,
you draw the short sword you only just started weilding days ago for
this jouney.

The ghoulish monster shrieks and lunges forward.
*stabmist* Counterattack.
*dodgemist* Step back.

stabmist:
You wildly stab your into the mist while keeping yourself as far as
possible from the thing. Your unimpressive sword travels forward with
the also unimpressive weight of your entire body. It touches the
mist. Enters it. Then goes through the ghoul, meeting no
resistance. Before realizing any of this, you find yourself on the
floor in front of you. You've fallen with your own lunge.

A panicked look over your shoulder reveals a light spread of dust
behind you.
*investigatedust* Investigate the dust.
*runcaveexit* Run to the cave's exit.

dodgemist:
You stumble backwards. A small outcropping of rock blocks your right
heel from gonig further, and you fall backwards. There's cold rush of
wind as the ghoul screeches over you.
It's defeaning as it passes. Then howls deep into the cave behind.
You get up, brushing some black dust off yourself.

Time to go.
*runcaveexit* You run to the cave's exit.

hidemist:
The ghoul glides forward into the cave. There are no footsteps. A low
howl follows it.
It moves, stops, then moves again. Another pause. Is it looking for
you?
Moves again. Pauses. Does it know?

It's close now. Just a quick lunge away.
*stabmist* Attack from the shadows.
*continuehidemist* Continue hiding.

continuehidemist:
The shadowy figure covered in mist passes slowly beside you. You turn
your face into your shoulder, attempting to muffle the sound of your
breathing.

Just as it passes you, the ghoulish figure starts to speed forward. It
glides quickly into the depths of the cave, with a wind trailing
behind it.
*runcaveexit* You run to the cave's exit.
