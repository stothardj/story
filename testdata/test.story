start:
A cold mist rises just outside the cave as you walk out to see an
unfamiliar land.  The trees here are still green, healthy, reminding
you of what the rotting husks in your now dreary village once
were. Just at that moment as you reminisce, an unintelligible echo
comes from the cave behind you.
*faceecho* Turn to face it.
*hideecho* Take cover.

faceecho:
You slowly turn around. Facing the source of the sound, you see
nothing. The light from your torch struggles against the almost
unnatural darkness, but fails after only a few feet. Dim shadows dance
along the walls in a ring around you. The sound is gone. A falling
rock? But it sounded nothing like that.
Silence now. The air grows colder.
It's time to leave this cave. You turn back to the cave's
entrance. The mist is thicker than before.  Much thicker. And in the
middle of it, there's a subtle but unmistakable outline of a shadowy
figure.
*seemiststanding* You confront the shadowy figure.

hideecho:
You slide behind a boulder, still far enough into the cave to have the
darkness conceal you.  Your body is presses against the damp cold rock
awkwardly, but you hold still, straining to hear a repeat of the
sound. A gentle breeze blows from the inside of the cave. And with it,
it carries a stream of mist curling around the rocks, joining with the
mist already present at the entrance.
Slowly, but unmistakably, a shadowy figure is taking form in the mist.
*seemiststanding* Stand to confront the figure.
*hidemist* Continue to watch from the shadows.

seemiststanding:
For a brief moment you and the shadowy figure stand motionless
opposite each other. All is silent.  Dread starts setting in. Slowly,
you draw the short sword you only just started weilding days ago for
this jouney.

Suddenly the ghoulish monster shrieks and lunges forward.
*stabmist* Counterattack.
*dodgemist* Step back.
